            Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour <br>
            When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore? <br>
            When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor? <br>

            Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down <br>

            Um, I see the light <br>
            To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you? <br>
            I see the light <br>
            That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do <br>
            I see the light

            Dracula, Dracula, Dracula <br>
            Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light) <br>
            Is that shit clear? Check the aperture <br>
            Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light) <br>
            This the shit that make you nervous <br>
            'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light) <br>
            Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one <br>
            Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)

            [Verse 4] <br>
            That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha) <br>
            Green haired angels all around me (Uh) <br>
            No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the) <br>
            That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck <br>
            I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death <br>
            New album, no repeat, I reset <br>
            Everything I deliver special like G. Dep <br>
            Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam <br>
            Me and death, the universe played middle man <br>
            Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut <br>
            Loud sound, no scratch <br>
            Motherfuckers really thought I died <br>
            Hoping they could take a spot <br>
            Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one <br>
            And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas <br>

            I see the light (I said) <br>
            I see the light <br>
            I see the light <br>
