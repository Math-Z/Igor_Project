            [Verse 1] <br>
            Ayo <br>
            I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk <br>
            I wanna walk to your front door and knock <br>
            After I start my vehicle <br>
            Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart <br>
            Land at your driveway and put it in park <br>
            Then do the third line of this verse <br>
            Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes <br>
            And we ride through the park, chase the sun <br>
            God, that's all I want, other than air <br>
            Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah <br>
            I want your company, I need your company <br>
            I want you to want from me <br>
            I can't maneuver without you next to me <br>
            It's so complex to me

            [Verse 2] <br>
            What do you need? <br>
            Do you need bread? Do you need this? <br>
            Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone? <br>
            I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead <br>
            What is your wish? It can be granted <br>
            You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa <br>
            Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic <br>
            I do not have self-control <br>
            I am startin' to wonder <br>
            Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

            [Chorus] <br>
            I'm your puppet, you control me <br>
            I'm your puppet, I don't know me <br>
            (Did I wait too long?) <br>
            I'm your puppet <br>
            (Did I wait too long?) <br>
            You control me <br>
            (Did I wait too long?) <br>
            I'm your puppet <br>
            (Did I wait too long?) <br>
            I'm lonely <br>
            'Cause I'm your puppet <br>
            (Puppet, oh) <br>
            You control me (Control me) <br>
            I'm your puppet (Puppet) <br>
            I don't know <br>
            I'm your puppet (Did I wait too long?) <br>
            You control me (Puppet)

            (La, la, la) <br>
            Breathe on a song <br>
