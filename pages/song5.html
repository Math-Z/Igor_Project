            [Verse 1] <br>
            Secrets <br>
            Oh, you spin my head around (Oh, you spin my head around) <br>
            I been lookin' for it (For it, for it) <br>
            I been runnin' out of spells <br>
            To make you love me <br>
            Secrets <br>
            Keep it up <br>
            To make you love me (Ah) <br>
            Wade in your water (Wade in your water) <br>
            Your waves wash over me <br>
            I drift to the deep end <br>
            Don't save, don't save, don't save <br>
            It's a low tide (I'll be fine) <br>
            I found peace in drownin'
