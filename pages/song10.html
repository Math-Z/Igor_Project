            [Verse 1] <br>
            Comparing scars before dinner <br>
            Jump off the roof into the mirror <br>
            Felt like summer to my December <br>
            Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember <br>
            (Two, three, go) <br>
            I know my temperature was set <br>
            You finally flew south <br>
            The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic <br>
            At least I had it (Uh) <br>
            Instead of never <br>
            Or maybe I'm too dramatic <br>
            (Two, three, go)

        <p>
            [Chorus] <br>
            Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now <br>
            My love's gone, my love's gone <br>
            My love's gone, oh, gone <br>
            (Two, three, go) <br>
            Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from <br>
            My love's gone, my love's gone <br>
            My love's gone, gone

            [Verse 2] <br>
            I know love is, is all I got <br>
            I just hope to God she got good taste <br>
            Could put you on some shit you never seen <br>
            Could play a couple songs that you could dance to <br>
            I hope you know she can't compete with me

            My love's gone, my love's gone <br>
            My love's gone, oh, gone <br>
            Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from <br>
            My love's gone, my love's gone <br>
            My love's gone, oh, gone

            [Bridge] <br>
            You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep) <br>
            You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep) <br>
            You keep me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone) <br>
            Going away, and now I'm scarred for life

            [Verse 3] <br>
            (My love is gone) <br>
            Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo <br>
            Emotion, feel Dumbo <br>
            Ask me where my love go <br>
            That bitch walked outside the front door <br>
            (My love is gone) <br>
            Knock, knock, knock, knock <br>
            I'm not shocked, I brought this on me <br>
            It's my fault, you gon' leave <br>
            Lesson taught, see <br>
            The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin' <br>
            My stupid ass brought umbrellas <br>
            I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better <br>
            Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve <br>
            Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions <br>
            You got your thing, I got nothing but memories <br>
            I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah) <br>
            I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that <br>
            Everybody making a choice according to plan and <br>
            We had two different blueprints, but understood influence <br>
            You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit <br>
            You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence <br>
            Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant <br>
            I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease <br>
            You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it <br>
            But I finally found peace, so peace <br>
            (Want me do it over? Everything)

            [Outro] <br>
            I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit <br>
            It really does, it crushes your soul
