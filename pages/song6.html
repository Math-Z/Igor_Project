            [Verse 1] <br>
            I saw a photo, you looked joyous <br>
            My eyes are green, I eat my veggies <br>
            I need to get her out the picture <br>
            She's really fuckin' up my frame <br>
            She's not developed like we are

            [Refrain] <br>
            Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone <br>
            New magic, new magic, new magic wand <br>
            Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga) <br>
            New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

            [Verse 2] <br>
            My brother said I'm on the spectrum <br>
            Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin' <br>
            This 60-40 isn't workin' <br>
            I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

            [Chorus] <br>
            Please don't leave me now <br>
            Please don't leave me now (Don't leave) <br>
            Please don't leave me now <br>
            Please don't leave me now (Don't leave) <br>
            Please don't leave me now (Don't leave) <br>
            (Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone) <br>
            Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave) <br>
            (New magic, new magic, new magic wand) <br>
            Please don't leave me now (Don't leave) <br>
            (Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone) <br>
            Please don't leave me now <br>
            (New magic, new magic, new magic wand)

            [Verse 3] <br>
            I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave) <br>
            You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park (I can make her leave) <br>
            She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave) <br>
            We can finally be together

            [Bridge] <br>
            You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right <br>
            Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck? <br>
            Your other one evaporate, we celebrate <br>
            You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't <br>
            (Run, run, run, run) <br>
            I'll pick you both <br>
            (Run, run, run, run) <br>
            It's not a joke, murder she wrote

            [Verse 4] <br>
            Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear <br>
            I live life with no fear, except for the idea <br>
            That one day you won't be here <br>
            I will not fetch the ball <br>
            Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables <br>
            It has nothin' to do with that broad <br>
            But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well <br>
            I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen <br>
            If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym <br>
            Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest <br>
            That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them <br>
            Can't be in the picture if it got no frame <br>
            Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame <br>
            Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain'tâ€“ <br>
            I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one <br>
            Not the other one, keep it on the low <br>
            I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high <br>
            Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em <br>
            Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store <br>
            Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door <br>
            Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned <br>
