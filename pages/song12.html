            [Verse 2] <br>
            Don't get green skin (Green skin), keep contact (Keep contact) <br>
            Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (Later) <br>
            Nah, I can't <br>
            I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah <br>
            Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall <br>
            Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls <br>
            You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it <br>
            You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend
